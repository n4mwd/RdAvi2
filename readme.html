<h1><b>RdAvi2 &ndash; Read AVI 2.0</b></h1>
<h4>AVI File Format Display Program - Written by Dennis Hawkins April 18,
2024.</h4>

<p></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">This program is a command line utility that will
read an AVI file, including those that are over 2GB in size, and display the
internal AVI file structure contents. Its purpose is for debugging and
educational purposes. It works for most AVI files, so generally
speaking, if the file extension is &lsquo;.AVI&rsquo; then it will probably
work fine.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This program was developed in C using Borland C++ v5.02 running under Wine
on a Linux development system. So it runs under windows, from Win95 through
Windows 11, or under Linux using Wine.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To run it from a windows command prompt, enter the following:</p>

<p></p>

<p style="text-indent: 100px"><b>C:\&gt;</b> <span
style="background-color:#ffff00">RdAvi2 YourAviFile.avi</span></p>

<p></p>

<p>To run under Linux, wine must be installed, and then enter:</p>

<p></p>

<p style="text-indent: 100px"><b>user@mx: ~$</b> <span
style="background-color:#ffff00">wine RdAvi2.exe YourAviFile.avi</span></p>

<p></p>

<p>There are currently no command line switches. Upon pressing enter, your file
will be loaded and then displayed in the command line console. Because the
output can sometimes be overwhelming and larger than the console&rsquo;s look
back buffer, it is recommended to redirect the output to a file. Such as:</p>

<p></p>

<p style="text-indent: 100px"><b>C:\&gt;</b> <span
style="background-color:#ffff00">RdAvi2 YourAviFile.avi
&gt;output.txt</span></p>

<p></p>

<h3><b>Sample Output:</h3>

Display the contents and file structure of an AVI file.
This program will work on most AVI files including Open-DML
files that are bigger than 4GB.

<h3>History</h3>

<p></p>

<p>I needed to write an AVI library in C that would handle files bigger than
2GB. I found several C libraries, but none were ODML or AVI 2.0 compatible. So
in writing my own AVI library, I tried to use ReadAVI.exe written by Michael
Kohn to display the internal AVI file structures. Unfortunately, while ReadAVI
works on regular AVI files, it does not work at all on AVI 2.0 files.</p>

<p></p>

<p>So I got sucked into a rabbit hole modifying Mr. Kohn&rsquo;s code to make
it work with the AVI 2.0 extensions. I say rabbit hole because it didn't take
long for me to realize that I wasn&rsquo;t modifying his code, but rather
rewriting it altogether. This is why the copyright says that this program,
RdAvi2.exe, was inspired by Mr. Kohn&rsquo;s code rather than a
modification.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Either way, the version of ReadAVI that I started with was licensed under a
BSD license, so I have preserved that here with my RdAvi2 program.</p>

<p></p>

<p>My program is brand new so there might be some bugs. I tested it with every
AVI file I could get my hands on, and they all worked. Let me know if you find
one that doesn&rsquo;t work right.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h3>Building from Sources</h3>

<p></p>

<p>This project was designed to run on Windows from the command line. It was
developed on a Linux machine running Wine which runs code for Windows. I used
Borland C++ v5.02 for the compiler which is an outstanding older compiler that
is free to download and use. I have included a compiler generated MAKE file, but
basically, you just add all the C source files to your project and then click
compile. With Borland C++ there are no other files necessary to run it, so no
dotNet junk or MsVcRt stuff to find and install. The exception is that if you
are going to run it under Linux, you will need to install WINE to enable
Windows compatibility.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Borland C++ compiles ANSI C syntax so most other 32 bit ANSI C compilers
will likely work fine with little to no code modification. One thing that might
not work right in other compilers is the way that I handle FourCC codes and
tags.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When I read a FourCC tag into memory, I read it as a 4 character string
buffer, then cast that to a DWORD for storage. Then, later in the program when
I need to compare that to a known tag value, I overstuff the character quotes
to form a multi-character literal. So if I have the tag from the file in dwTag,
I can simply compare it to say &lsquo;RIFF&rsquo;, like: <br>
<pre style="margin-left: 100px;font-size: 18pt">if (dwTag == &lsquo;RIFF&rsquo;) <i>&lt;do something&gt;</i></pre></p>

<p></p>

<p>I have seen other people&rsquo;s code where they painstakingly manually
reverse the buffer characters after reading, and then set up some sort of macro
to reverse multi-character literals so that the order matches. I skipped all
the reversing stuff and everything worked out just fine with the Borland
compiler. I mention this because I don&rsquo;t think the way Borland handles
multi-character literals is a standard so other compilers may fail with this
code.  In that case, a reversing macro may be necessary for multi-character 
literals used in this program.</p>

<p></p>
